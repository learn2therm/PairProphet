PairProphet is a software pipeline developed at the University of
Washington. This package implements a  “first-pass” model that 
allows researchers to draw on existing proteome data and generate 
a pairwise screening that will narrow down their search space and 
vastly reduce screening time. Our pipeline leverages machine learning 
to train a model based on alignment metrics from multiple programs, 
centralizing the searching process to one software pipeline that can 
be executed with a single command.
